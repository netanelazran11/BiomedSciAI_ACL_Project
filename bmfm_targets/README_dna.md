## Introduction

`biomed-multi-omic` is a comprehensive software package that not only facilitates this combinatorial exploration but is also inherently flexible and easily extensible to incorporate novel methods as the field continues to advance. It also facilitates downstream tasks such as promoter prediction task, splice site prediction, transcription factor prediction and promoter affect on gene expression prediction task using benchmark datasets such as GUE from DNA-BERT2 and MPRA data.

## Package Architecture

### DNA Modules

The `bmfm-dna` framework addresses key limitations of existing DNA language models by incorporating natural genomic variations into the pre-training process, rather than relying solely on the reference genome. This allows the model to better capture critical biological properties, especially in regulatory regions where many disease-associated variants reside. As a result, `bmfm-dna` offers a more comprehensive and biologically meaningful representation, advancing the field beyond traditional DNALM strategies.

`bmfm-dna` framework diagram schematic shows the modules avaliable for multiple strategies to encode natural genomic variations; multiple architectures such as BERT, Performer, ModernBERT to build genomic foundation models; fine-tuning and benchmarking of the foundation models on well-established biologically meaningful tasks. In particular, the package incorporates most of the benchmarking datasets from Genomic Understanding and Evaluation (GUE) package released in DNABERT-2. In addition, the package also supports promoter activity prediction on datasets created using Massive Parallel Reporting Assays (MPRA), and SNP-disease association prediction.

## Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to create your enviroment due to it's 10-100x speed up over pip.

```sh
python -m venv .venv

pip install uv
uv pip install "git+github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic.git"
```

Install uisng `pip`:
```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "git+github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic.git"
```

Install using cloned repo:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic.git

# Change directory to the root of the cloned repository
cd biomed-multi-omics
# recommended venv setup (vanilla pip and conda also work)
uv venv .venv -p3.12
source ./.venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```
<!--
### Optional dependencies
In addition to the base package there are additional optional dependencies which extends `bmfm-mulit-omics` capabilites further. These include:
- `bulk_rna`: Extends modules for extracting and preprocessing bulk RNA-seq data
- `benchmarking`: Installs additional models used benchmark `bmfm-mulit-omics` against. These include scib, scib-metrics, pyliger, scanorama and harmony-pytorch.
- `test`: Unittest suite which is recommended for development use

To install optional dependencies from this GitHub repository you can use the following structure:

```sh
uv pip install "git+github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic.git#egg=package[bulk_rna,benchmarking,test,notebook]"
``` -->

## Quick start


### Downloading DNA checkpoint

The model's weights can be aquired from [IBM's HuggingFace collection](https://huggingface.co/ibm-research). The following DNA models are avaliable:

- MLM+REF_GENOME [ibm-research/biomed.dna.ref.modernbert.113m](https://huggingface.co/ibm-research/biomed.dna.ref.modernbert.113m.v1)
- MLM+REFSNP_GENOME [ibm-research/biomed.dna.snp.modernbert.113m](https://huggingface.co/ibm-research/biomed.dna.snp.modernbert.113m.v1)

For details on how the models were trained, please refer to [the BMFM-DNA preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05265).


### Fine-tuning on a biological task containing DNA-sequences

For fine-tuning DNA pre-trained model on a new biological task involves first creating a dataset folder with three files train.csv, test.csv and dev.csv. The framework will
look for these files for model development automatically. Each file should contains at least two columns. The first column must contain the dna sequence and then followed by the class labels, where column names are passed in the LabelColumnInfo yaml.
Additional columns (e.g., seq_id) can follow in each of the files which will not be used.

As an example of 'Sample' dataset with the multiclass prediction problem where there are two regression lables measuring gene expression in types of genes: development and housekeeping (Dev_enrichment, HK_enrichment), the dataset siles should be like follows:

```csv
sequence, Dev_enrichment, HK_enrichment, seq_id
ACGTTTACCCCTGGGTAAG, -0.24, 0.35, seq_99
```

Next, the yaml file has to be created properly. A simple finetuning yaml for single classification task is provided [here](../run/dna_finetune_train_and_test_config.yaml).

For a new dataset such as the drosophilla expression prediction task, the corresponding datamodule and LabelInfo yaml should be overridden as belows:

```

label_columns:
- _target_: bmfm_targets.config.LabelColumnInfo
  label_column_name: "Dev_log2_enrichment"
  is_regression_label: true
- _target_: bmfm_targets.config.LabelColumnInfo
  label_column_name: "Hk_log2_enrichment"
  is_regression_label: true

data_module:
    defaults: dna_base_seq_cls
    max_length: 80
    dataset_kwargs:
      processed_data_source: ${input_directory}
      dataset_name: ${dataset_name}
      label_dict_path: ${input_directory}/${dataset_name}_all_labels.json


trainer:
  batch_size: ${batch_size}
  learning_rate: ${learning_rate}
  losses:
    - name: mse
      label_column_name: ${label_columns[0].label_column_name}
    - name: mse
      label_column_name: ${label_columns[1].label_column_name}

  ```


```bash
export MY_DATA_FILE=... # path to the three (train/test/dev.csv) files
bmfm-targets-run -cn dna_finetune_train_and_test_config input_directory=$MY_DATA_FILE output_directory=/tmp checkpoint=ibm-research/biomed.dna.snp.modernbert.113m.v1
```


### Zero-shot inference (CLI)
`biomed-multi-omic` allows for multiple input data types, but the core data object at the heart of the tool is based around the adata object. Once your dataset is created.

To get DNA embeddings and zero shot cell-type predictions:

```bash
export MY_DATA_FILE=... # path to the three (train/test/dev.csv) files
bmfm-targets-run -cn dna_predict input_file=$MY_DATA_FILE working_dir=/tmp checkpoint=ibm-research/biomed.dna.snp.modernbert.113m.v1
```

### Running pre-training framework

Our framework supports running pretraining framework using MLM or supervised loss on a class label or both. Please refer to this [readme](README.md) for details on running pre-training on both scRNA and DNA framework.

For pre-processing DNA datasets using both reference and SNPified version, please use the [steps](README_SNP_PREPROCESSING.md) for pre-processing before running the pre-training framework.


### Snpification of the finetuning data

We preprocessed a few datasets to impute SNPs extracting from the reference genome. The easiest way to impute such SNPs is to map each input dna sequence to the reference geneome if the chromose and position location of the sequence is availabe. For example, we extracted the promoter location from [here](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) provided by EPDNew. Then we use the [notebook script](datasets/dnaseq/preprocess_dataset/snpify_promoter_dnabert2_v1.ipynb) to preprocess the promoter dataset to impute SNPs. In this version, the negative sequences were imputed with random SNPs coming from the same distribution of the positive set (Class 1 of the paper). Note that the notebook requires reference genome fasta data (fasta_path), preprocessed SNPified chromosome-wise data (cell 4 of the notebook) for both forward and reverse strands, which can be downloaded from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15981429).

For other types of SNPification of data, we had different scripts which are available upon request.


### Running fine-tuning tasks of DNA

Please refer to the [readme](evaluation/benchmark_configs_dna/README.md) for running the 6 finetuning tasks of DNA.
